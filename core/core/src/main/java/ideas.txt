Managed property reloading

Problem, managed beans only reload currently at their own level.
They should reload the entire dependency graph wherever needed.

We face two problems first we can have deep dependency graphs
Secondly multiple beans can reference the same bean and also
can have long running scopes.

We cannot for now solve all problems related to dependency graph reloading
but we can solve most.

First deep graphs.

The copy properties has to be extende, first we have to walk through the entire dependency
graph and in case of managed properties we have to reload the instances in case
of having a manged property. (Simply fetch the bean instead of
simply copying the old one)

Long running beans, this is not really possible to resolve for now because
we do not have back references to the old beans, programmers
must use either a manual load for long running beans referencing others, or simply
live with it.


We probably in the long run can introduce a scoped proxy doing it, but then
we have to work over interfaces again, which is contra productive.

Solution for now we probably have to allow a scoped proxy system within jsf
not sure how to solve this fully yet.


We have to deal in two stages with the problem

first make a forward referencing reloading mechanism for the current state
secondly deal with parents as soon as we can determine them by
simply touching the corresponding parent source files, or make a full graph and then even mark
the precompiled parents as cascadable
