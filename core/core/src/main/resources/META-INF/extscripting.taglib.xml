According to the spec we normally should divide between facelet 1.0 and facelet 2.0
but since this seems to be a spec errata in the JSF 2.0 rev 0 spec and both implementations
now pick up facelet 1.0 files as expected we centralize everything and keep everything on 1.2
jsf level for now.
Maybe in the long run we will divide both component classes into one for jsf 1.2 and
one for jsf 2.0 but for now this approach is fine enough.
