    <section name="General Information">
        <p>As of now the project is in alpha stage, so no stable release has happened.
            While we personally think the project already has beta quality, no official beta has been done yet.
        </p>
        <p>The best bet to try Ext-Scritping for now is a source build from maven (see link below)</p>
        <p>For Binary Builds from maven you can use the Alpha Repository or the trunk
            (see
            <a href="installation">The Ext-Script Installation Page</a>
            for further information)
        </p>
        <p>The Binary Alpha 1 Release can be found in http://people.apache.org/~lu4242/extscript100alpha</p>
        <p>Binary Packages for manual installation will follow before or with the final Release</p>
