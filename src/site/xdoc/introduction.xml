            <subsection name="General Introduction">

                <p>Welcome and hello to MyFaces Extension-Scripting, short Ext-Scripting. Ext-Scripting is an extensions
                    project for MyFaces. It tries to add scripting and rapid prototyping capabilities to JSF by adding
                    scripting languages and JSP like recompilation mechanisms.

                    Following link to the a video on YouTube shows you what Ext-Scripting can do for you:

                        <object width="480" height="385">

                            <embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/vUCCTCMjTPE"
                                   type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always"
                                   allowfullscreen="true"
                                   width="480" height="385"></embed>
                            <param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/vUCCTCMjTPE"></param>
                            <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param>
                            <param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param>

                        </object>
                    </center>
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the video shows you can make changes to JSF artifacts on the fly and at the next reload the
                    changes are present. The result is a reduction in server restarts and better turn around times. The
                    same rapid prototyping approach which is normally present in scripting languages and scripting
                    language based frameworks.

                    Additionally to that Ext-Scripting integrates various scripting languages to be used in conjunction
                    with JSF so that a mixed language approach becomes feasible within the bounds of the framework.

        <section name="Various Aspects of Ext-Scripting">
            <subsection name="Supported for Scripting Languages">
                <p>
                    Ext-Scripting currently only supports Groovy as only scripting language.
                    Additional scripting languages will be provided in subsequent releases.
                </p>
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="Support for JSF2 and JSF2 Artifacts and Annotations">
                <p>
                    One of the main goals of Ext-Scripting was to provide JSF2 support out of the box. Most new JSF2
                    artifacts are supported. Ext-Scripting even adds scriptability to the new annotation syntax of JSF2
                    by
                    allowing annotations to be used in a dynamic manner!
                </p>
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="Support for MyFace">
                <p>
                    Extensions scripting supports MyFaces only for now. Following versions are supported.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1.2.8+</li>
                    <li>2.0+</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Older versions are not supported due to missing plugin mechanisms which allow Ext-Scripting to work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The JSF RI and Mojarra as time of writing are not supported due to missing framework hooks needed,
                    but Mojarra supports Groovy out of the box within the core engine. So for the time being only
                    MyFaces can be used. Also Portlets for 1.0 are not supported, this limitation will be eliminated in
                    future versions. Support for Mojarra will come post 1.0.
