                <p>Welcome and hello to MyFaces Extension-Scripting, short Ext-Scripting. Ext-Scripting is an extensions
                    project for MyFaces. It tries to add scripting and rapid prototyping capabilities to JSF by adding
                    scripting languages and JSP like recompilation mechanisms.

                    Following link to the a video on YouTube shows you what Ext-Scripting can do for you:

                 <p>
                     As the video shows you can make changes to JSF artifacts on the fly and at the next reload the
                    changes are present. The result is a reduction in server restarts and better turn around times. The
                    same rapid prototyping approach which is normally present in scripting languages and scripting
                    language based frameworks.

                    Additionally to that Ext-Scripting integrates various scripting languages to be used in conjunction
                    with JSF so that a mixed language approach becomes feasible within the bounds of the framework.

            <subsection name="Supported for Scripting Languages">
                <p>
                    Ext-Scripting currently only supports Groovy as only scripting language.
                    Additional scripting languages will be provided in subsequent releases.
